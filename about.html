                    <li>Although my schoolworks may sound quite like traditional engineering stuff, which are all about math, algorithm, supply chains, etc., I actually combine a lot of my courseworks with Human-related disciplines, such as ergonomics, UX design, Work organizations. 
                    I consider myself to be abound in emotions, hence the trace of humanistics is always necessary in my life.</li>
