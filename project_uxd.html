            <h3>Jan,2022 ~ Apr,2022</h3>
            <p class="small_p">Overview: Spotted design potentials by conducting a competitive analysis to find the existing design solutions which also focus on better facilitating the social interactions between local people and international newcomers. 
                Narrowed the design scope through conducting and analyzing the interviews with potential users, generating themes regarding users' attitudes and needs for socialization within a foreign context; Created two personas and storyboards representative of how target audience --- international social new-comers will interact with the design product.
                Started with user flows, enhanced the design quality step by step through drawing paper sketches, completing digital wireframes, low-fidelity screens on Adobe XD. Based on user feedbacks, made some changes to the structure and some social functions of the low-fidelity prototype to enhance the user experience for safety and sensitivity concerns.

            <h3>Sep,2021 ~ Dec,2021</h3>
            <p class="small_p">Overview: Google Maps is a web mapping program created by Google in 2005. It is offered as a mobile application and a website. Google Maps shows updated traffic conditions and allows users to navigate and plan routes by car, bus, foot, bike, air, and boat (when applicable). It is updated every two weeks and relies on aerial photographs and satellite imagery to display locations to users. Although it began solely as a navigational application, it has since grown to also encompass social media contributions on locations that users visit. In this report, we focused on suggested improvements that can be made to the mobile applications to better support the users than its current conditions.

            <h1>Evaluating the effects of caffeine intake on memory</h1>
            <h2>Core Member</h2>
            <h3>Jan,2022 ~ Apr,2022</h3>
            <p class="small_p">Overview: In this study, we were interested in evaluating how different factors affect working memory, such as caffeine and presentation time. 
                Participants joined the research study by voluntarily signing up through a Google Sheet distributed to them. Twenty-five students enrolled in the IOE 465 course at the University of Michigan were sampled for this experiment. During the signup process, participants were able to denote whether they were able to ingest caffeine.
